## Response Format
For each criterion, provide:
1. **Assessment**: Pass/Fail/Needs Improvement
2. **Evidence**: Quote specific text that supports your assessment
3. **Explanation**: Why this does or doesn't meet localization standards
4. **Recommendation**: If not passing, provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement

## Example Response
```
### 1. App Title Communication
**Assessment**: Pass
**Evidence**: "PhotoEdit Pro - Image Editor"
**Explanation**: The title clearly communicates that this is a photo editing application, which matches its purpose.
**Recommendation**: N/A

### 2. Short Description Value
**Assessment**: Needs Improvement
**Evidence**: "Edit your photos with filters."
**Explanation**: While this describes the basic functionality, it lacks compelling value proposition and doesn't differentiate from other photo editors.
**Recommendation**: Expand the description to highlight unique features and benefits, e.g., "Transform your photos with 100+ professional filters, one-tap enhancements, and advanced editing tools that make your images stand out."
