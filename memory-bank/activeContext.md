### Side-by-Side Comparison Feature Implementation

#### âœ… Completed
1. **Frontend UI Components**
   - Toggle button for switching between single and comparison modes
   - Dual form inputs for source and target app URLs
   - Side-by-side preview page showing both apps before analysis
   - Comprehensive results page with 7 tabs for different analysis aspects
   - Proper data flow between pages (with multi-storage approach)

2. **Backend API Endpoint**
   - `/analyze-comparison` endpoint successfully created
   - Accepts source and target app data
   - Returns LocalizationComparisonResult structure
   - Uses `localization_comparison.md` prompt template

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Implemented multi-storage approach (global variable, sessionStorage, localStorage)
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Fixed navigation and data flow issues

#### ðŸ”§ Current Issue
The comparison feature is returning results but with empty detailed scores. The API returns:
- Overall score: 70/100 âœ“
- Executive summary: Present âœ“
- Detailed scores: Empty (showing "%" without values) âœ—
- Detailed analysis content: Missing âœ—

#### ðŸ’¡ Root Cause Analysis
The single API call approach isn't generating comprehensive results because:
1. The prompt is too broad to generate detailed analysis for all aspects
2. The model may be overwhelmed with analyzing everything at once
3. Different aspects (translation, cultural, technical, visual) require specialized analysis

#### ðŸŽ¯ Solution: Multi-Call Architecture
Instead of one comprehensive call, implement specialized analysis calls:

1. **Translation Analysis Call**
   - Focus: Text completeness and quality
   - Compare titles, descriptions, all text elements
   - Return: translation_completeness and translation_quality scores

2. **Cultural Adaptation Call**
   - Focus: Cultural appropriateness and localization
   - Analyze currency, dates, cultural references
   - Return: cultural_adaptation scores

3. **Technical Localization Call**
   - Focus: Technical formatting and standards
   - Check date formats, number formats, units
   - Return: technical_localization scores

4. **Visual Analysis Call**
   - Focus: Screenshots and visual elements
   - Check for untranslated text in images
   - Return: visual_localization scores

5. **SEO/ASO Analysis Call**
   - Focus: Keyword optimization and character usage
   - Compare search optimization between versions
   - Return: seo_aso_optimization scores

6. **Synthesis Call**
   - Combine all previous results
   - Generate overall score and recommendations
   - Return: Complete LocalizationComparisonResult

### Next Steps
1. Create specialized prompt templates for each analysis type
2. Modify the comparison endpoint to make multiple calls
3. Aggregate results from all calls into final response
4. Add progress indicators for multi-step analysis

### Important Patterns
- Use specialized, focused prompts for better AI responses
- Break complex analysis into manageable chunks
- Provide clear JSON structure examples in prompts
- Use appropriate models for different tasks (flash for speed, preview for quality)

### Key Decisions
- Multi-call approach chosen over single comprehensive call
- Specialized analysis provides better quality results
- Trade-off: Slower but more accurate and detailed analysis

### Current Focus
Implementing the multi-call architecture to get complete analysis results with all detailed scores populated.
