# Progress

*This document tracks what works, what's left, status, issues, and decision evolution.*

## What Works

### Backend API
-   Memory Bank structure established with initial content for all core files.
-   Project structure created: `src/api/`, `src/frontend/`.
-   `vertex_libs.py` moved to `src/api/`.
-   `src/api/requirements.txt` created with initial dependencies.
-   `src/api/main.py` created with:
    -   Basic FastAPI application instance.
    -   `/analyze` POST endpoint implemented using `vertex_libs.GeminiClient`.
    -   `/analyze-app-listing` POST endpoint implemented for app listing analysis.
    -   `/health` GET endpoint implemented.
    -   Basic request/response models (`AnalyzeRequest`, `AnalyzeResponse`, `AppListingAnalysisRequest`, `AppListingAnalysisResponse`).
    -   Environment variable loading (`.env`) for configuration.
    -   Basic logging setup.
    -   Absolute import of `vertex_libs` to support running directly from the `src/api` directory.
    -   Fixed import issue with Google Generative AI libraries to match the pattern used in `vertex_libs.py`.
    -   `src/api/Dockerfile` created for containerization.

### Frontend Application
-   Created `src/prompts/` directory with:
    -   `localization_criteria.md` containing the audit criteria.
    -   Prompt templates for text analysis, visual analysis, and comprehensive audits.
    -   Example files for good localization practices and common issues.
-   Set up Next.js project in `src/frontend/` with:
    -   TypeScript for type safety.
    -   Material UI for Google-like design.
    -   Custom theme with Google's color palette.
-   Implemented core components:
    -   Layout components (Header, Footer, Layout).
    -   URL input form for Google Play app listings.
    -   Results page with tabbed interface for displaying audit results.
-   Set up API service with:
    -   Integration with the scraper API for app listing data.
    -   Integration with the Vertex AI API for analysis.
    -   Fallback to mock data when APIs are unavailable.
-   Implemented navigation between home and results pages.
-   Added environment configuration with `.env.local`.
-   Added language and country detection and confirmation flow.

### Scraper API
-   Created `src/scraper/` directory with:
    -   FastAPI application for scraping Google Play app listings.
    -   Playwright integration for reliable scraping of dynamic content.
    -   Endpoints for language/country detection and app listing scraping.
    -   Comprehensive data extraction including:
        -   Basic app details (title, developer, icon, rating, reviews)
        -   Descriptions (short and long)
        -   Visual elements (screenshots, feature graphic)
        -   Ratings distribution
        -   App metadata (size, version, installs, content rating)
        -   Developer information (email, website)
        -   Privacy policy URL
        -   In-app purchases details
        -   App permissions
        -   Supported devices and OS requirements
        -   Update history
        -   User reviews and developer responses
        -   Similar apps
    -   Docker configuration for containerization.

## What's Left to Build

### Backend Enhancements
-   Add error handling and rate limiting for the scraper API.
-   Add caching mechanism to avoid repeated scraping of the same app.
-   Implement API authentication/authorization if needed.

### Frontend Enhancements
-   Improve error handling for API communication.
-   Add export functionality for audit reports (PDF, CSV).
-   Implement user authentication and history tracking (if needed).
-   Add more detailed recommendations based on audit results.
-   Implement comparison view for before/after changes.

### Deployment
-   Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
-   Configure production environment variables.
-   Implement monitoring and logging.

## Running the Application

### Backend API (Choose Local OR Docker)

**Option 1: Local Python Environment**
1.  **Set up Python Environment**: Create and activate a virtual environment (e.g., `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`).
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r src/api/requirements.txt`.
3.  **Configure GCP Project**: Create a `.env` file in the `src/api` directory with `GCP_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id`.
4.  **Authenticate with Google Cloud**: Run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
5.  **Run the API**: Navigate to the `src/api` directory and execute `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`.
6.  **Test the Endpoint**: Use `curl` (see below) or visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

**Option 2: Docker Container**
1.  **Ensure Docker is running.**
2.  **Configure GCP Project**: Create a `.env` file in the `src/api/` directory with `GCP_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id`.
3.  **Authenticate with Google Cloud (for building/running locally)**: Ensure your local Docker environment can access GCP credentials.
4.  **Build the Docker Image**: From the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    docker build -t vertex-api -f src/api/Dockerfile ./src/api
    ```
5.  **Run the Docker Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file src/api/.env -v ~/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud vertex-api
    ```
6.  **Test the Endpoint**: Use `curl` or visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Frontend Application

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**: `cd src/frontend`
2.  **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3.  **Run the development server**: `npm run dev`
4.  **Open in browser**: Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Current Status

-   Backend API structure and core endpoints implemented.
-   Frontend application implemented with Material UI and Google-like design.
-   Scraper API implemented using FastAPI and Playwright with comprehensive data extraction.
-   Language and country detection implemented in the scraper API.
-   Frontend updated to confirm language and country with the user.
-   Complete flow from URL submission to analysis results implemented.
-   Vertex AI integration implemented for analyzing app listing data.
-   Enhanced scraper API to extract more detailed information.

## Known Issues

-   None currently.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   Initial request: Build a FastAPI endpoint using `vertex_libs.py`.
-   Decision 1: Implement Cline's Memory Bank for documentation and context persistence.
-   Decision 2: Adopt a `src/` directory structure containing `api/` and `frontend/` subdirectories.
-   Decision 3: Standardize on the import pattern `from google import genai` and `from google.genai import types` for Google Generative AI libraries.
-   Decision 4: Use absolute imports in `main.py` to support running the app directly from the `src/api` directory.
-   Decision 5: Use Next.js with Material UI for the frontend to create a Google-like experience.
-   Decision 6: Organize localization criteria into categories for better structure and clarity.
-   Decision 7: Implement a service layer for API communication to make it easier to switch between mock data and real API.
-   Decision 8: Create a separate scraper API using FastAPI and Playwright for reliable scraping of Google Play app listings.
-   Decision 9: Structure the project with separate services (frontend, scraper API, Vertex AI API) for better scalability and maintenance.
