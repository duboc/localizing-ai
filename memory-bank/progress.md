# Progress

## Overview
Building a Localization Quality Analysis Tool that helps app developers evaluate and improve their Google Play Store listings across different languages and markets.

## Completed Features

### 1. Core Infrastructure ‚úì
- FastAPI backend with Vertex AI integration
- Next.js frontend with Material-UI
- Multi-service architecture (API, Scraper, Frontend)
- Docker containerization for all services

### 2. Web Scraping Service ‚úì
- Google Play Store scraper with language/country support
- Comprehensive data extraction (title, descriptions, screenshots, reviews, etc.)
- Language/country detection from URLs
- Error handling and retry logic

### 3. Single App Analysis ‚úì
- Complete analysis flow from URL input to results display
- Specialized analysis endpoints for different aspects
- Comprehensive results UI with categorized feedback
- Mock data fallback for development

### 4. Documentation & Project Setup ‚úì
- **Comprehensive README**: Updated with current architecture, features, and setup instructions
- **Professional Presentation**: Added emojis, clear sections, and visual diagrams
- **Complete Getting Started Guide**: Step-by-step setup for all services
- **Deployment Documentation**: Cloud Run and Docker Compose instructions
- **API Documentation**: Complete endpoint reference
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

### 5. Side-by-Side Comparison Feature üîß
**Status: 90% Complete - Needs Multi-Call Implementation**

#### What's Working:
- Toggle between single and comparison modes
- Dual form inputs for source/target apps
- Side-by-side preview of both apps
- Basic comparison API endpoint
- Results page with 7 analysis tabs
- Data persistence across navigation

#### What's Not Working:
- Detailed analysis scores are empty
- Single API call approach isn't generating comprehensive results
- Need specialized analysis for each aspect

## Current Task: Implementing Multi-Call Architecture

### Problem
The comparison endpoint returns overall scores but empty detailed analysis because the single prompt is too broad for the AI to handle effectively.

### Solution
Break the analysis into specialized calls:

1. **Translation Analysis** - Compare text completeness and quality
2. **Cultural Adaptation** - Analyze cultural appropriateness
3. **Technical Localization** - Check formatting standards
4. **Visual Analysis** - Examine screenshots and graphics
5. **SEO/ASO Analysis** - Compare keyword optimization
6. **Synthesis** - Combine results and generate recommendations

### Implementation Plan
1. Create 5 specialized prompt templates
2. Modify comparison endpoint to make multiple calls
3. Aggregate results into final response
4. Add progress tracking for multi-step analysis

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Multi-Call?
- **Better Results**: Focused prompts generate more detailed analysis
- **Reliability**: Each aspect gets proper attention
- **Flexibility**: Can use different models for different tasks
- **Debugging**: Easier to identify which analysis is failing

### Trade-offs
- **Speed**: Multiple calls take longer (15-30 seconds total)
- **Complexity**: More code to maintain
- **Cost**: More API calls to Vertex AI

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today)
   - Create specialized prompt templates
   - Implement multi-call logic in comparison endpoint
   - Test with real app comparisons

2. **Short Term** (This Week)
   - Add progress indicators for analysis steps
   - Implement caching for repeated analyses
   - Add export functionality for results

3. **Medium Term** (Next Month)
   - Add batch analysis capabilities
   - Implement user accounts and saved analyses
   - Create comparison history tracking

## Key Metrics
- Single app analysis: ~5 seconds
- Comparison analysis: ~20 seconds (current), targeting 15-30 seconds with multi-call
- Analysis depth: Currently 30% ‚Üí Target 90% with multi-call

## Lessons Learned
1. **AI Prompts**: Specialized, focused prompts > comprehensive prompts
2. **Data Flow**: Multiple storage methods ensure reliability
3. **User Experience**: Preview before analysis improves workflow
4. **Architecture**: Breaking complex tasks improves quality

## Technical Debt
- Need to implement proper error boundaries in frontend
- Should add retry logic for failed API calls
- Cache analysis results to avoid repeated API calls
- Add request queuing for rate limiting

## Success Criteria
‚úì Users can analyze single apps
‚úì Users can compare two app versions
üîß Analysis provides detailed, actionable feedback
‚è≥ Results are comprehensive and accurate
‚è≥ System is reliable and performant
